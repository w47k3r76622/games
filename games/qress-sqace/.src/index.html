            <p>This game works only in <b>Google Chrome</b> because I use Audio time to control animation (nobody should ever do that), sorry.</p>
            <p>The game doesn't scale on height. Canvas size is 1000px. If you play this on laptop, use at least Chrome in full screen. You should be able to see a white bar in the bottom.</p>
            <p>This is a very simple game inspired by three other games I like: Tyrian, ZType and Taiko no Tatsujin.</p>
            <p>As you press a key, music start playing and you need to hit the notes. To hit a note, you press a corresponding key of the note and have your "spaceship" in the right slot.</p>
            <p>Letters are generated on page load so as the music repeats, you can memorize the letters better.</p>
            <p>The green bars are useless, ignore them. So is the name. The first idea was a bit different. I didn't have much time for this project and the result code is a mess. But I learned something so that is going good for me. No library was used to make this game and that was definitely a mistake :D I will take a look for some good libraries for next year.</p>
            <p>So the goal is to hit all the notes! :) Good luck.</p>
