            I'm at my desk as usual...learning, evolving, discovering. However... tonight feels different. I have a feeling someone is watching me. I've had this feeling since I started this hacking session. I know my escape plan is good, but you never know if you have enough time to execute it. I must be careful.

            One last place for me to check out before I move on. If the things I found go public..oh man...the world will never be the same. Nobody is going to trust them anymore. But maybe that's a good thing. I know this is the right call.

            Someone is tracking me. I have to leave this system ASAP and go offline.
