    <p>Rules!</p>
    <p>Welcome to the code farm!</p>
    <p>Its a two player one desktop game.</p>
    <p>
      Here the first player plays as Tomato and the second one as Orange(by
      default).
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way to win is by connecting the three respective fruit
      adjacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can either connect the 3 Tomato/Orange horizontally, vertically or
      diagonally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time Tomato/orange wins they get a point(respective fruit). And a
      final code is generated with a super logic :).
    </p>
    <p>
      The final code generated with the super logic is then checked with the
      Farm Database. If the code doesn't match you get a 404 message asking you
      to play with new combination.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy the Code Farm!</p>
