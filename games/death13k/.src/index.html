      You are a Reaper. You pickup new souls and take them to their
      afterlife. Watch out for Wraiths. Souls left to linger in limbo
      too long will turn into Wraiths. Wraiths will eat the soul
      you're carrying. If you are not carrying one it will eat a part
      of yours. Run out of essence and it's game over!
