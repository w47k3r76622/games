You have connections to several deep and dark web users. They have informed you that they have seen websites, known for human trafficking, that have posted advertisements with her picture. These websites are only accessible by using the T.O.R network. A network designed to mask origins of internet connections to keep communications hidden. Like any system, it has its weak points. These dark web user friends of yours have taught you secrets of the trade of computer hacking and tracking. You have now built a tool to help you narrow down the I.P. addresses of these website owners. The T.O.R. network masks its users by bouncing their signals all across the globe so much so that they are almost impossible to track. You however are able to pinpoint the different nodes and find the roots of the signals. Your tool will allow you to select IP addresses and determine if it is a node being used. This tool will let you know how accurate your choice is so you can make a more precise selection to further your tracking. You only have so long before you are locked out of the system's vulnerabilities and only have so many attempts to analyze I.P. addresses as well. Use this time appropriately! You will need to lock onto several signals to find the captor of your loved one. Happy Hunting!</p><button onclick=beginClicked()>BEGIN</button></div><table><thead><tr class=green><th>IP ADDRESS<th>ACTIVE<th>HOST_NAME<th>MACHINE_TYPE<th>LAST_RESPONCE<th>SYSTEM_LOCATION<tbody id=entry_table></table></section><hr><section class=response-wrapper><table id=attempted-ips><thead><th class=green>ATTEMPTS<th class=green>SHARED CHARS<tbody id=attempts_table></table></section></section><script src=app.js></script>
